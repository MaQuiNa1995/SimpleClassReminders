# SimpleClassReminders

**SimpleClassReminders** is an addon that provides on-screen reminders for important class-related basics, helping players avoid forgetting essential buffs, pets, and weapon enhancements.

---

## 🔔 How It Works

SimpleClassReminders continuously checks your character and group state and displays **clear text reminders at the top-center of the screen** whenever an important requirement is missing.

For example:
- A group member dies and loses a buff
- You forget to resummon a pet
- A weapon enchant or poison is missing
